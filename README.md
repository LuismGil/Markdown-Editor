This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Markdown Editor

This is another of my FreeCodeCamp projects "Markdown Previewer". Its main function is to serve as a markdown editor and reflect it in the preview.

I used the marked.js library to apply the markdown functionalities.

I also used external sources like Bootstrap for some styles.

If you want you can see the app in the following [link](https://luismgil.github.io/Markdown-Editor).
